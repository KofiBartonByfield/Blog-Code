# Data Driven Blog Post on HIV/AIDs

## This is the README for my blog exploring global patterns surrounding the outbreak of HIV/AIDs.

I'm hoping to complete a Master's in in Modelling for Global Health at the University of Oxford next year as this is an area I am passionate about learning. I see this as a brilliant way to improve my knowledge and skills in the area, as well as add to my ever growing portfolio of health related data driven projects.

The project addresses several key objectives. Firstly, it serves as a platform for raising awareness about the global prevalence and impact of HIV/AIDS. By analysing real-world data, the blog post aims to shed light on the distribution and trends of HIV/AIDS across different regions, thus contributing to public understanding and discourse surrounding this critical health issue. Secondly, the project showcases the application of advanced data science techniques to tackle real-world health challenges. Through the use of data scraping, cleaning, visualization, and machine learning methodologies, the blog demonstrates the efficacy of data-driven approaches in gaining insights into complex health phenomena.

Furthermore, the project represents a significant learning opportunity for the me. Throughout the exploration process, I gained proficiency in various aspects of data science, including data scraping and cleaning techniques essential for preprocessing raw datasets. Additionally, the project provided hands-on experience in data visualization using popular libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn, enabling the author to effectively communicate findings through informative visualizations. Moreover, the implementation of machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest regression, streamlined the extraction of valuable insights from the data, enhancing my understanding of predictive modelling in health analytics. Overall, the project emphasises the importance of data-driven decision-making in addressing pressing global health challenges.
